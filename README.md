## Applied Data Analysis for Public Policy
### NYU CUSP Spring 2018
This repo contains both homeworks and research project on policy analysis. 

### Research Project Overview
Our objective is to measure gentrification at the residential level and find out if the
creation of a Business Improvement District as an economic development policy could actually
cause the phenomena. Recognizing the complexity of defining the term, at Advancing Our
Understanding of Gentrification Ingrid Ellen and Lei Ding state “The term gentrification
inevitably generates controversy and disagreement. (...) While the papers included in this volume
adopt slightly different definitions, they generally view gentrification as increases in household
income, education, and/or housing costs in previously low-income, central city neighborhoods.
Some also consider increases in percentage white households.” 1 . We are going to use this
definition to define our model outcome variable(s).

### Research Question
Do Business Improvements Districts (BIDs) cause residential gentrification in New York
City? The hypothesis is: when comparing neighborhoods that were economically and
demographically similar before the intervention (becoming a BID), those that become BIDs are
more gentrified than those that do not become BIDs.
Given than, as explained by Ellen and Ding, gentrification accrues to low-income central
city neighborhoods, we are going to evaluate if there are any differences in the effect of BIDs
between neighborhoods of different income levels across New York City. We’ll use K-means for
classifying the different geographies (Census Tracts) into groups according to their income and
racial composition.
There will be several models depicting changes in the above mentioned variables: 1)
increases in income, 2) education level, 3) housing costs and 4) percentage of white households.
We are also going to look at 5) increase in population moved in during the last year. In all of
those models we are going to include the status of BID/non-BID as our predictor variable.
Moreover, we are going to control for initial characteristics of the neighborhoods (pre-
intervention).
